This is just a general overview of the contents of this project folder. These files will be hosted on the web server to serve the webpage.

There are three components that make up the front-end (what the user sees).
index.html (Title, headers, content, footers, ie. the underlying structure of the page)
styles.css (Formatting layout, colors, fonts)
script.js (JavaScript file that enables the dynamics of the page)

The other two files are for the back-end (processing transactions between the page and underlying database.
