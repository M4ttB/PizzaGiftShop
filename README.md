# LAMP stack built with Docker Compose

!This is just a general overview of the contents of this project folder. These files will be hosted on the web server to serve the webpage.
This is LEMP Stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP)

There are three components that make up the front-end (what the user sees on the webpage).
index.html (Title, headers, content, footers, ie. the underlying structure of the page)
styles.css (Formatting layout, colors, fonts)
script.js (JavaScript file that enables the dynamics of the page)

The other two files are for the back-end (enables processing transactions between page and MySQL).
createTables.txt (creates the tables for the MySQL database)
submit_order.php (PHP file for submitting orders to database)

Everything is currently WIP
